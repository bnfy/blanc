# Mail and Suite sandbox setup — September 24, 2026

Suite sandbox benefit: `c5ebb27b-529f-43f4-946a-5fcde32d4ad0` in the existing
Bananify Creative sandbox organization `a6ffc65a-8ba3-4973-8a2a-e057aa811f9f`.
It grants the $7/month and $70/year Suite products. Browser's production Suite
allowlist remains empty, and the public Mail pages remain coming soon.

Mail has a separate benefit, `819e65da-12b8-4cb4-a32d-329446b40811`, for its
$4.99/month and $49.99/year products. It is not in Browser's allowlist. Existing
Patron and founding products/benefits were not changed. All four new products
are private in the sandbox customer portal, use no checkout trial, and grant
only their corresponding Mail or Suite license benefit.

The new benefits have unlimited activations and no fixed expiry. The
[Polar license-key guide](https://polar.sh/docs/features/benefits/license-keys)
describes expiry as a duration from purchase; it must not be assumed to equal a
subscription renewal date. Mail's paid-through offline behavior remains a
launch gate until actual purchased-key responses establish the required data.

An invented invalid key sent to the public sandbox validator returned HTTP 404
`ResourceNotFound`. Browser previously treated all non-OK validation responses
as an outage; it now invalidates an explicitly rejected key. The regression
failed before the fix, then all 19 focused licensing tests and ESLint passed.
Network failure, 429, and 503 retain Browser's existing grace policy.

Purchase submission, issued-key activation in both apps, cancellation,
offline/relaunch, and the confirmed prorated Patron-to-Suite upgrade remain
pending. Product and checkout identifiers plus the detailed matrix are recorded
in the Mail repository's `docs/POLAR_MAIL_SUITE_SANDBOX.md` in
[PR #67](https://github.com/bnfy/Postel/pull/67).
