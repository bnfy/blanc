# Electron 1.38 UI migration follow-up

Owner requested this next on October 18, after the native recovery checkpoint.
Source inventory: `origin/main` at `7f57544b` (package version 1.38.0), compared
with the fork's last reconciled main `01cf07d7`. A partial preview is implemented; see `evidence/ui138-preview-20261018/`.
The inventory below remains the full target, not a claim of complete parity.

## Port and verify

1. Shared Island presentation: address-only hover opening, larger row icons,
   Glance icon, custom tooltips, matching reload/favorite/close geometry,
   quieter private chip and borders. Reference commits `379bb5fb`, `7422c94e`,
   `6e37b112`, `559e3aa3`. Check native Extensions slot alignment and preserve
   focus return and keyboard shortcuts.
2. Side-list ordering and groups: interleaved loose runs, Recently Closed,
   group colors/tinted blocks, rename/menu actions, new-tab-in-group and move
   group to a new window. Native Chromium contiguous groups and prohibition
   on grouped pins remain constraints, not silently emulated guarantees.
   Port the actual tab-sections helper and test every exposed bridge method.
3. Tab context menu: New Tab Below, Close Above/Below and site mute. Native
   model actions must preserve tab IDs, pin/group boundaries and private scope.
4. Start Page: wallpaper-blended footer, owner-selected image (F49) and Spaces
   color (F50). Image selection/storage requires an actual native implementation;
   do not show a working picker backed only by an Electron IPC stub.
5. Fixed-size before/after screenshots in regular/private, Island collapsed/open,
   grouped/ungrouped and Start Page states; actual pointer/keyboard checks where
   available. Record any unsupported feature alongside the UI diff.

Work stays in the isolated prototype. Prefer copying reviewed shared sources
from the pinned release commit over duplicate hand edits. Do not wholesale merge
shipping main into the active F12 checkpoint without reviewing its broader diff.
Use asset preparation for renderer-only changes and the existing guarded warm
157 output for necessary native changes. The upstream patch budget is already
40 files / 92 hunks; no new upstream file without consolidation or owner decision.
Latency remains deferred, Electron diagnostic build remains unapproved, and
neither this work nor its visual comparison promotes 157 past the upgrade gate.

## October 18 preview checkpoint

Reviewed renderer/assets, group colors and menus, rename/new-tab/ungroup/move-to-window,
bounded tab context actions, custom wallpaper and fixed color presets are ported.
79 reviewed pure-module tests, scoped lint, native bridge and browser automation
checks pass. Physical interaction and matched visual comparison remain pending.
Vertical rail, Recently Closed, site-wide mute, Glance and Spaces remain gaps.
The image adapter stores a bounded re-encoded JPEG in profile-local WebUI storage;
see evidence for limits and unsupported format/sync coverage.

Owner-reported Start Page overlap exposed a separate 157 preparation bug: a broad
`present` marker matched the separator patch and skipped the native 68px header
reservation. The marker is now unique, with an idempotence/regression test. This
fix touches an already-inventoried file; final build/geometry evidence is recorded
in the preview archive. No CSS spacer was added to web content.

## October 18 rail, Recently Closed, site mute and Store follow-up

Implemented native page-width reservation and hit testing for the reviewed vertical rail,
profile-local layout/width preferences, native TabRestoreService entries/restore/forget/clear,
and exact-host session-only site mute with independent private policies and per-tab unmute.
No new upstream path: 40 files / 94 hunks. Native rail switching, page click-through,
keyboard width change, menu site mute and Recently Closed row restore were exercised.
Bridge tests cover new/existing same-host tabs, host transitions, private isolation,
restore/forget and native viewport resize. Restart preserved rail width and closed entries,
cleared site mute, and showed an empty error status. Forget All passes on the final binary.

The owner-requested Chrome Web Store promotion rule is exact-origin and download-campaign
scoped, runs in Chromium's internal isolated world, and hides only the promotional container.
Normal Google installation of Extensity 1.14.0 passed through the native permission sheet
and success bubble; persistence and native removal passed. Test profile removed; original
preview New Tab and Store tabs restored. This is not a UA spoof or permission bypass.

Evidence: `evidence/ui138-rail-store-20261018/` (31 hashed archive members).
Four focused tests and scoped lint pass. Incremental successful wrapper times:
39.57, 57.36 and 41.97 seconds; failed 14.66/35.98-second attempts retained. Final guard zero.
Remaining: full matched visuals, broader rail drag/group/window restoration qualification,
and reconciliation of Chromium's profile-wide Recently Closed list with Electron's window-local
semantics. Glance/Spaces remain unported. The promotion may briefly paint before load callbacks;
its empty wrapper remains labelled in AX, and the separate inline Chrome-install banner is
outside the popover rule. Latency stays deferred; Electron diagnostic build remains unapproved.
Task 0 promotion/upgrade gate and F12 acceptance gaps are unchanged.

## October 18 rail/restore and visual acceptance follow-up

Native drag/keyboard, tab/group/window restoration and private isolation now have bounded
acceptance evidence. Fixed opaque rail renderer paint, redundant rail header offset, loose-tab
end-of-strip movement and insertion before a group's first tab; interior/pinned targets stay
rejected. Matched 1280x800 rail/panel geometry and private color pass; Billboard's 68px header
reservation matches. Component screenshots are not complete composed visual parity: content,
pill controls, Start Page features, narrow/DPI/palette/find and wider lifecycle cases remain gaps.
Evidence: `evidence/ui138-acceptance-20261018/` (hashed archive, failed attempts retained).
79 renderer tests, three promotion tests and scoped lint pass. Two incremental builds 44.17s
and 43.66s; final guard zero. Budget unchanged at 40 files / 94 hunks; no increase needed.
Disposable profiles removed; original two preview tabs restored. Recently Closed remains
profile-wide; Spaces/Glance unported. Plan item 4 started, incomplete; items 3/5/6 unchanged.
Latency deferred, Electron diagnostic build unapproved/unstarted; F12/Task0 gates unchanged.

## October 18 narrow/palette/find diagnostic checkpoint

Native command entry now selects palette mode, full-window scrim/hit region and copied
repeat-command selection behavior; click/typing/new-tab entries remain panel mode. Five
actual Chromium sizes, 1280x700 through 500x400 pass bounded palette geometry/typed-selection
checks. Crowded 500x400 panel/list/footer and rail scrolling pass. Electron reference uses
renderer viewport emulation and diagnostic palette CSS, not native window/keyboard input.
Electron actual find API returns 1/1 fixture match at five sizes; Chromium Blanc find capsule
and bridge remain unported (/find filtered out), native Find not tested while locked.
Native Cmd-L/Escape/outside-click acceptance awaits unlock; no physical checks claimed.
At <=800px native controls require Chromium panel y48 vs Electron y12; full composed/DPI/
private parity remains open. Evidence: `evidence/ui138-narrow-palette-20261018/`.
One 37.69s incremental build, six steps; final guard zero; 40 files / 94 hunks unchanged. Four regressions
and focused host lint pass. Disposable fixtures removed, original preview two tabs restored.
Plan item4 in progress; previous F12/Task0 gates unchanged. Latency deferred; Electron
diagnostic build unapproved/unstarted. Find migration and unlocked input are next gaps.

## October 18 find-capsule checkpoint

The copied Electron 1.38 find capsule now uses Chromium WebContents Find/StopFinding and
window-local result events. Native Find and Find Next/Previous route through the capsule;
/find is restored. Stale request IDs, inactive/foreign tabs and navigation resets are guarded.
The query limit is 4096 UTF-8 bytes; case-insensitive search uses Chromium's engine.

Automated final-binary checks match installed Electron 1.38 on four matches including a
same-origin iframe, next/previous/wrap, Unicode and zero results. Rapid query replacement,
cross-document reset, tab switch/closure, same-document preservation, private isolation,
foreign/inactive rejection, slash listing and empty host status pass. Command helper calls
exercise the Cmd-G destination, not physical shortcuts. Capsule bounds pass at actual native
1280/800/500px widths. Component screenshots are not full composed visual parity.

Two incremental builds: 62.04s and 60.37s wrapper (58.06s and 55.07s Siso), 15 steps each.
Final guard zero actions; footprint 40 upstream files / 96 hunks, within 40/120. Four focused
regressions, syntax and focused host lint pass. No cold build, GN/toolchain change or latency run.

Failed harness attempts retained: private context requested on page endpoint instead of browser
endpoint; immediate post-restart connection before browser readiness; Node 20 invocation without
experimental WebSocket support. Final matrix and commands pass. Diagnostic background flags
were used only in disposable instances because the Mac is locked. Profiles removed and fixture
server stopped; original preview New Tab and Store restored on final binary with empty status.

Native Cmd-F/Cmd-G/Enter/Shift-Enter/Escape/button clicks, focus/passthrough, IME, VoiceOver,
DPI/full composed visual comparisons, PDF/cross-origin frames and crash/BFCache remain untested.
Native input stays pending unlock. Plan visual item 4 remains incomplete; prior F12/Task0 gates
unchanged. Latency deferred; Electron diagnostic build remains unapproved/unstarted.

Evidence: `evidence/ui138-find-20261018/`. Build times are routine incremental work, not Task 0 cold-build cost.

## October 18 expanded find and visual checkpoint

An actual crash of the exact active disposable tab left its find capsule visible. The native
owner now retires the request ID and query/count state and resets the capsule when the primary
renderer exits, without sending StopFinding to a dead renderer. The before-fix regression fails;
the final binary closes the capsule and searches successfully after navigation reload. This is
bounded regular-tab recovery, not every crash/BFCache/private lifecycle combination.

Eight queries agree with installed Electron 1.38: cross-origin iframe (different local port),
open shadow DOM, hidden text exclusion, input/textarea text, Japanese, accented text and no match.
Six component style comparisons (1280/500px, light/dark/private diagnostic theme attributes)
match rendered dimensions, colors, borders, radii, fonts and shadows for the six capsule controls.
Empty, no-match and 300-character no-match states agree on count and outer bounds. Input client/
scroll metrics differ between Chromium152 and157 (24px client difference); recorded, not hidden
or presented as full pixel equivalence. Native CSS sizing and Electron viewport emulation are
explicitly distinct. Matching-DPR clipped component captures supplement the numeric checks;
these are diagnostic theme renders, not physical private-window/input or whole-window parity.

One guarded incremental build: 41.02s wrapper /37.23s Siso, six steps from a one-action plan.
Final guard zero; budget unchanged40 upstream files /96 hunks. Four focused tests pass. No cold
output, GN/toolchain change, latency test, or Electron diagnostic build. Binary hashes recorded.
Failed window-target harness attempt and overstrict client-metric comparison retained. The
first broad crash probe did not establish exact active-target identity; only crash-before/after
with unique URLs qualify that regression. CDP crash and dead-runtime timeouts are recorded.

Disposable profiles and fixture servers removed; original two preview tabs preserved and
reopened on the final binary. Native input stays pending unlock. PDF, BFCache/back-forward,
private crash, IME, VoiceOver, physical display-scale, hover/focus and complete composed visual
parity remain gaps. Plan visual item4 remains incomplete; prior F12/Task0 gates unchanged.
Latency deferred; Electron diagnostic build remains unapproved/unstarted.

Evidence: `evidence/ui138-find-expanded-20261018/`. Build time is routine incremental work, not Task0 cold cost.

## October 18 BFCache/private find checkpoint

Regular A→B→back A→forward B restores the same document instance markers and records
pageshow.persisted=true in both documents. Find closes at each cross-document transition,
then finds the expected two/three matches after each actual BFCache restore. Private A→B→back A
also restores the same document with persisted pageshow and successful find. No forced BFCache
flags, Playwright browser defaults or assumed reload-as-cache pass were used.

A fresh private window exposed a theme gap: direct-open Find skipped the copied panel renderer's
private-theme application. The prototype host now applies or clears that scope from its active
native tab snapshot before opening Find. This is an assets-only integration fix; copied Electron
source is unchanged. The first failing theme assertion is retained, not counted as a pass.

Private search, cross-window and inactive-tab rejection, tab-switch/navigation resets, reopen,
BFCache restore and exact active private renderer crash/reload pass. Regular listeners receive
no private search results; private Recently Closed stays empty. Disposing the private context
removes its targets, regular find still works and the regular theme remains non-private. Crash
transport/dead-runtime timeouts are retained. This tests one bounded private context, not every
multi-window/subframe/process-sharing schedule or durable profile-forensics guarantee.

No native compilation. Assets-only prepare 0.05s; final guard zero actions (3.39s); native binary
hashes identical to the prior expanded-find checkpoint. Native patch footprint remains 40 files /
96 hunks because no native/preparation source changed. Four focused regressions, host syntax and
focused lint pass. Disposable profile/server removed; original preview's two tabs restored.

Native input remains pending unlock. PDF, IME/VoiceOver, physical focus/hover/display-scale,
BFCache eviction/ineligible pages, private forward restoration, private subframe crashes and full
composed visual parity remain gaps. No Electron comparison is claimed for these lifecycle runs;
installed Electron was not launched. Visual plan item4 remains incomplete. Latency deferred;
Electron diagnostic build unapproved/unstarted; prior F12/Task0 gates unchanged.

Evidence: `evidence/ui138-find-lifecycle-20261018/`. No change to the Task0 cold-build column.

## October 19 PDF and private lifecycle find checkpoint

An authored two-page text PDF contains three occurrences of needle. Chromium's real PDF viewer
loads it and native Find reports all three matches in regular and private windows. Regular next/
previous returns 1→2→1; no-match returns zero in both windows. PDF→HTML navigation resets the
capsule and HTML search succeeds. Private theme and cross-window rejection pass; private search
produces no regular-window result events. PDF fixture pages and the actual viewer capture were
visually inspected. This is a simple selectable-text PDF, not OCR, encrypted or form-document coverage.

Private A→B→back A→forward B preserves each document instance and reports persisted pageshow;
find resets at transitions and returns the expected three matches after forward restoration.
Removing a cross-origin iframe during an open find session leaves zero child matches on a fresh
query while parent text remains searchable. Closing the active searched tab resets the capsule;
private Recently Closed remains empty. Context disposal removes its targets and regular host
status remains empty. These are real bridge/engine checks, not physical key or pointer events.

No production code changes, preparation or compilation were needed. Build guard zero actions
(5.38s); native hashes unchanged from the expanded-find checkpoint, footprint remains 40 files /
96 hunks. Focused host lint passes. No repeat unit suite is claimed for this evidence-only change.
Disposable profile/server removed; original two preview tabs restored. Initial Poppler rendering
emitted Fontconfig configuration/cache warnings; a fixture-local config/cache rerender completed
and both pages were inspected. No system font configuration changed.

Remaining: PDF wrap/end-page selection, PDF reload/crash/plugin lifecycle, scanned/encrypted/forms,
cache eviction/ineligible pages, private subframe crashes/process sharing, IME/VoiceOver/physical
focus/display scale and full composed visual parity. No new Electron comparison was run. Native
input remains pending unlock; latency deferred; Electron diagnostic build unapproved/unstarted.
Visual plan item4 remains incomplete; previous F12/Task0 gates unchanged.

Evidence: `evidence/ui138-find-pdf-20261019/`. No change to Task0 cold-build costs.

## October 19 PDF reload/crash checkpoint

Regular and private selectable-text PDF find each return three matches before reload, after
Page.reload, after an actual outer-page renderer crash and recovery navigation, and after switching
away and reselecting the PDF tab. Reload/crash/tab transitions reset the capsule. The crashed target
rejects/times out a Runtime evaluation; crash command responses are retained. Private theme stays
private, closing the searched private PDF resets find, private Recently Closed remains empty and
private context disposal succeeds. Page.crash selected the PDF URL's outer page target: this does
not prove independent PDF plugin-process crash recovery. No physical keyboard/mouse acceptance.

No production changes or compilation. Guard zero actions (3.59s); native hashes match the prior
PDF checkpoint. Footprint remains 40 upstream files/96 hunks (not re-enumerated for evidence-only
work). Setup failures were a sandbox ps denial and immediate CDP-readiness race; both occurred
before test cases and are recorded in attempts.json. Final browser results are in results.json.
Disposable profile/server removed; existing preview tabs and empty host status verified without
relaunching the preview. No new Electron comparison, unit suite or PDF visual comparison claimed.

Remaining: independently selected PDF plugin failure, scanned/encrypted/forms and selection/wrap,
cache eviction/ineligible pages, private subframe crashes/process-sharing, IME/accessibility/full
visual parity. Native input pending unlock, latency deferred, Electron diagnostic build unapproved
and unstarted. Visual item4 and previous F12/Task0 gates remain incomplete/unchanged.

Evidence: `evidence/ui138-find-pdf-recovery-20261019/`. No Task0 cold-cost change.

## October 19 PDF-plugin/private subframe checkpoint

Regular and private tests separately select exactly one process with both the disposable profile
argument and --pdf-renderer, record its command line, kill that process, verify its exit, and prove
the outer PDF page retains its JavaScript marker. Reload resets Find and restores all three text
matches in both profiles. This closes the bounded independent PDF-renderer recovery case rather
than repeating the earlier outer-page crash. The find capsule remains open immediately after
plugin death in both profiles; fresh-query/no-reload behavior and crash-state UI handling remain
unqualified. The recovery pass does not imply that the capsule automatically clears on plugin exit.

A private cross-site iframe (localhost child inside 127.0.0.1 parent) is independently exposed as
an iframe CDP target. Page.crash times out as recorded; parent marker survives, parent search
returns one match and child search returns zero. Navigating the child again restores two matches;
removing it returns zero. Private theme, closed-tab empty Recently Closed and context disposal
pass. No broader process-sharing or simultaneous-frame failure claim is made.

Evidence-only, no production changes or compilation. Guard zero actions (4.14s); native hashes
match the previous PDF checkpoint. Footprint remains 40 upstream files/96 hunks (not re-enumerated).
Disposable profile/server removed; preview original tabs and empty status verified. No physical
input, Electron comparison or repeat unit suite claimed. The fixture is the previously authored
selectable-text PDF, unchanged; no new rendering/visual comparison is claimed.

Remaining: plugin crash-state capsule handling and no-reload queries, complex/scanned/encrypted/
form PDFs, concurrent renderer failures, cache eviction/ineligible pages, wider private frame
process-sharing, IME/accessibility/full visual parity. Native input pending unlock; latency deferred;
Electron diagnostic build unapproved/unstarted. Plan item4 and prior F12/Task0 gates unchanged.

Evidence: `evidence/ui138-find-plugin-20261019/`. No Task0 cold-cost change.

## October 19 PDF-plugin find reset fix

The active WebContents observer now retires its find session when a PDF renderer frame is deleted,
including independent plugin-process exit. The shared renderer-loss reset invalidates request ID,
query and cached counts, then closes the capsule; late find replies are ignored. Ordinary subframe
deletion does not take this path. Main-frame crash behavior uses the same reset helper.

Final native tests kill a uniquely identified disposable --pdf-renderer in regular and private
windows and prove the outer page's marker survives. The capsule now closes in both cases (prior
checkpoint recorded false). Reopening find WITHOUT reloading returns final zero matches for both
needle and a missing query, without hanging; this does not resurrect the crashed PDF or claim its
text remains searchable. Reload restores three matches. Private cross-site iframe crash, parent
search, missing child search, child recovery/removal, theme and closure regressions also pass.

One guarded incremental build: 38.53s wrapper /34.85s Siso, six steps, from a one-action plan.
Final guard zero (4.68s). Fresh footprint 40 upstream files/96 hunks, within 40/120. No new upstream
file, cold output, GN argument or toolchain change. Native binary hashes and invocation records
are archived. Disposable profile/server removed, original preview relaunched on the final binary
and original tabs/empty status verified. No new unit suite, Electron comparison or physical-input
claim; the actual native regression is the acceptance test.

Remaining: complex/scanned/encrypted/forms PDFs, multi-plugin/concurrent failures, broader cache/
private process-sharing/accessibility/full visual cases. Native input pending unlock; latency
explicitly deferred; Electron diagnostic build unapproved/unstarted. Plan item4 and earlier
F12/Task0 gates remain incomplete/unchanged. Build time is routine, not Task0 cold cost.

Evidence: `evidence/ui138-find-plugin-fix-20261019/`. No Task0 cold-cost change.
