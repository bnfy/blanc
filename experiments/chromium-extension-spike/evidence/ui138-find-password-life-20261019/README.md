## October 19 PDF password lifecycle checkpoint

Eight actual viewer-dialog observations pass across regular/private windows: initial open,
Page.reload, closing/reopening the same URL, and reopening the same URL after a full browser
restart using the same disposable profile. Every checkpoint presents a visible password dialog
with an empty input. Pre-unlock search observations contain no positive result; correct re-entry
restores two matches. The fixture is unchanged AES-256 with a public, nonsecret test password.

The first browser exits with a private PDF open. Its PID is confirmed absent before relaunch;
the second browser has a different PID and uses the same profile directory. Startup targets
contain only New Tab and host, no prior private PDF. The post-restart regular/private URLs are
opened explicitly: this does not qualify automatic session restore, crash restore or Recently
Closed restoration. These observations establish re-prompt behavior for the tested paths, not
proof that no password bytes ever reach memory/disk or a general persistence/security audit.

No production changes or compilation. Guard zero5.64s; hashes match the PDF reset binary;
footprint remains40files/96hunks (not re-enumerated). No latency run, unit-suite repeat, Electron
comparison or physical input claim. Disposable profile/server deleted; preview original tabs
and empty host status preserved. Before/after results, PIDs, fixture and harness archived.

Remaining: automatic session/crash/RecentlyClosed restore, password-manager integration,
permissions-only encryption/other algorithms, XFA/OCR/form edits, extreme PDFs and wider
lifecycle/accessibility/fullvisual coverage. Native input pending unlock; latency deferred;
Electron diagnostic build unapproved/unstarted. Plan item4 and prior F12/Task0 gates unchanged.

18 archive members hash verified; profiles/raw browser logs excluded.
