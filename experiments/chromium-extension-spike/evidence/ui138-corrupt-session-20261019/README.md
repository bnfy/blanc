## October 19 corrupt-session checks

Seven bounded cases ran in offline copies of disposable regular/private PDF session seeds.
Mutations were made only after owned browser processes exited: invalid first eight bytes,
half-file truncation (retaining header), or deletion of Session_* files. Before/after sizes and
SHA-256 values are recorded. Intact control restores the regular PDF; private PDF never restores.
The first matrix damages only Default/Sessions while Sessions_Encrypted remains intact;
restoration there does not establish recovery from loss of both stores. A fresh seed supplies
three cases damaging both stores. Tabs_* and other profile data remain untouched.

| Case | Original regular PDF restored | New page/search and next clean restore |
| --- | --- | --- |
| intact | True | pass |
| invalid-header | True | pass |
| truncated | True | pass |
| missing | True | pass |
| both-invalid-header | False | pass |
| both-truncated | False | pass |
| both-missing | False | pass |

A fallback to New Tab is startup resilience with original-session data loss, not successful
restoration. Every case accepts a new authored page, native Find returns one match, and that
new page restores and searches on the next clean launch. No private URL appears. No fatal or
dangling-pointer diagnostic appears across the run. These are CDP/bridge checks; no recovery
button, filesystem permission failure, partial-write concurrency, Tabs_* corruption, encrypted
key loss, OS reboot or general profile-corruption resilience is claimed.

Evidence-only: no production changes or compilation; guard zero3.62s, binary hashes unchanged,
40files/97hunks not re-enumerated. Disposable profile copies/server removed, original preview
preserved. Native input pending unlock, latency deferred, Electron diagnostic build unapproved.
Plan item4 and broader F12/Task0 gates remain open; no cold-build column change.

39 hashed archive members; profiles/session binaries/raw logs excluded.
