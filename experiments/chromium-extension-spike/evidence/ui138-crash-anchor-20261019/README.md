## October 19 crash-recovery anchor repair

The existing BrowserView toolbar-provider integration now delegates through a Blanc-owned
adapter. App-menu bubbles receive the Island View anchor; other toolbar/menu operations
forward to Chromium. The recovery bubble is preserved, not suppressed. No new upstream
file: inventory is 40 files / 97 hunks (one additional BrowserView hunk; below 120).
The first implementation compiled but exposed a shutdown dangling toolbar pointer because
ToolbarView dies before the Island owner. A ViewObserver now clears that pointer at deletion.
The failed attempt and diagnostic are retained; final normal shutdown has no fatal/dangling report.

Two guarded incremental builds: 62.76 seconds (15 executed steps), then 38.61 seconds
(six steps) for the lifetime repair. Final guard: zero actions in 4.06 seconds. No cold
output, toolchain, GN-argument or latency changes. The inventory was measured before the
Blanc-owned lifetime repair, which adds no upstream file/hunk; final source patch is archived.

Actual normal same-profile session restoration passes: regular protected PDF restored without
manual navigation, empty password re-prompt, no observed positive pre-unlock result, two matches
after re-entry, private PDF excluded. The owned browser was then SIGKILLed and relaunched.
It survives, and Session.SessionCrashed.Bubble records SHOWN=1, ERROR=0. The harness initially
expected automatic crash restoration; that assertion correctly failed because the real recovery
bubble waits for user choice. Mac locked, so its native Restore button and visual placement
remain NOT RUN. No automatic crash-restore/password pass is claimed.

Separately, the existing Recently Closed bridge restores the saved window after the crash:
regular PDF password field is empty, re-entry yields two matches, private URL absent. This
is saved-entry restoration, not acceptance of the recovery bubble button. Harness readiness
failures and the corrected asynchronous helper are recorded in outcome.json. Disposable profile
and server removed; original preview New Tab/Web Store tabs restored on final binary with empty
status. Native input pending unlock; latency deferred; Electron diagnostic build unapproved.
Broader recovery/UI/accessibility and prior F12/Task0 gates remain open. Plan item4 incomplete.

46 hashed archive members; profiles/raw browser logs excluded.
